Comments: <br>
I randomly generated some numbers that caused an integer overflow. As such, my RunCollatz.out is kinda wrong. Sphere has no problems as it says to assume that no overflow operations will occur with their test cases, but this is not true for my test cases.

I attest that I have written every line of code I have submitted (except for code provided by the instructor) and I take full responsibility for the origin of all the code submitted. In particular, if any of the code was originally written in a previous semester or another course I will so acknowledge via e-mail to the grader. <br>
